# Classify-Song-Genres-from-Audio-Data

Using the pandas, seaborn, and sci-kit learn Python packages, we trained a classifier to discriminate between two musical genres (Hip-Hop and Rock) using only track information derived from Echonest (now part of Spotify).

The objective is to predict, using PCA, logistic regression, and decision trees, whether we can correctly classify a song's genre based on features such as danceability, energy, acousticness, and tempo.
